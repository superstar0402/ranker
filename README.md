# Borrower Ranks

## Description

**Borrower Ranks** is an innovative extension designed to enhance peer-to-peer (P2P) lending protocols within the DeFi ecosystem. It introduces a dynamic scoring system for borrower profiles, leveraging blockchain technology for transparent and reliable reputation management. The core idea is to classify borrowers into categories based on the amount they typically borrow, with classifications such as small, medium, and large, defined by the platform's average loan sizes. Utilizing the EigenTrust algorithm from Karma3Labs, **Borrower Ranks** aims to provide a nuanced, trust-based scoring system, making it an essential tool for any P2P lending protocol seeking to integrate sophisticated borrower evaluation mechanisms.

## Technology Used

- **EigenTrust (Karma3Labs)**: Utilized to rank borrowers' profiles based on their borrowing history, enhancing the trust and reliability of P2P lending.
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum
- **Layer 2 Solution**: Optimism, for scalable and cost-effective transactions
- **Smart Contract Development**: Solidity, for creating the ranking logic and interfacing with Karma3Labs' API
- **Data Indexing and Querying**: The Graph, to manage and index on-chain data relevant to borrower activities
- **Identity Verification**: Decentralized Identity (DID) solutions for secure borrower verification
- **Upgradeability**: OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts framework to ensure future improvements can be made seamlessly

## Core Smart Contracts

1. **BorrowerClassification.sol**
   - Classifies borrowers into tiers based on loan amounts, applying the EigenTrust algorithm for dynamic scoring.
   - Key Functions: `classifyBorrower`, `getBorrowerScore`.

2. **MockStats.sol**
   - A mock contract to simulate borrower stats for testing the ranking system.
   - Key Functions: `createMockBorrower`, `simulateLoanActivity`.

3. **IntegrationAdapter.sol**
   - Bridges **Borrower Ranks** with existing P2P lending platforms, enabling easy integration of the scoring system.
   - Key Functions: `integrateWithLendingPlatform`, `fetchAndUpdateScores`.

## Architecture

**Borrower Ranks** employs a robust and flexible architecture, ensuring its scoring system is both accurate and easily integrable with existing DeFi lending platforms.

- **Smart Contracts**: Developed in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, forming the core logic for borrower classification and scoring.
- **Layer 2 Optimism Integration**: Enhances transaction efficiency, crucial for platforms with high user activity.
- **Data Management via The Graph**: Facilitates efficient on-chain data indexing, crucial for real-time borrower score updates.
- **Secure Identity Verification**: Utilizes DID protocols, reinforcing the trustworthiness of borrower scores.

### Questions for Further Integration

1. **APIs Linked to EVM Addresses**:
   - To what extent can Karma3Labs' API provide personalized rankings directly linked to EVM addresses? This is crucial for associating borrower scores with specific blockchain identities.

2. **Customization**:
   - Given the unique requirements of our P2P lending protocol, how customizable is the EigenTrust implementation by Karma3Labs? Specifically, what data points and borrower behaviors can be factored into the scoring algorithm, and how can these be adjusted to suit our platform's needs?

3. **On-Chain Data Requirements**:
   - For implementing a smart contract like **MockStats.sol**, which simulates borrower statistics, what specific on-chain data would be most beneficial for Karma3Labs' algorithm to accurately rank borrowers? Understanding this will help in designing contracts that provide meaningful, actionable data to the EigenTrust algorithm.
